# ESP8266
The ESP8266 WiFi Module is a self contained SOC with integrated TCP/IP protocol stack that can give any microcontroller access to your WiFi network. <br>
It can act both as a **Access Point** (can create hotspot) or as a **Station** (can connect to Wi-Fi) depending on the application, hence it can easily fetch and upload data it to the internet.<br>
Okay! Now letâ€™s see how to connect a WiFi module to USB to TTL(CP2102)!

## Documentation
It is highly recommended to go through the Documentation first.<br>

## Connections
* Rx(ESP8266) ---> Tx(USB to TTL)
* Tx(ESP8266) ---> Rx(USB to TTL)
* Power Supply (5V/3.3V and GND)
## Getting Started
Follow the steps for getting started:
* Connect the USB to TTL USB port with PC and open device manager to check the port connected with serial bridge.
* Open Realterm or any other serial terminal you want to use.
* Open the port to which your serial device is connected (make sure to check the baudrate as well).
* That's it!!! Now you can send AT commands using realterm directly to WIFI Module and also receive its response.
* Firstly check whether you receive OK in response to AT/r/n, to make sure that your connections and baudrate is fine.
* Now you can further proceed to other AT commands according to your application.
