# ESP8266
The ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module is a self contained SOC with integrated TCP/IP protocol stack that can give any microcontroller access to your Wi-Fi network. <br>
It can act both as a ```Access Point``` (can create hotspot) or as a ```Station``` (can connect to Wi-Fi) depending on the application, hence it can easily fetch and upload data it to the internet.<br>
Okay! Now letâ€™s see how to connect a Wi-Fi module to USB to TTL(CP2102)!

## Documentation
It is highly recommended to go through the Documentation first.<br>
Here are direct links for same.<br>

## Prerequisites
* [Realterm](https://realterm.sourceforge.io/index.html#downloads_Download) or any other serial terminal
* USB to TTL (CP2102)
* ESP8266 EVB
* Jumpers
* Basic knowledge of UART and serial communication
## Connections
![Alt text](Images/SCHEMATIC_ESP8266_2022_03_26.png?raw=true "Title")
* Rx(ESP8266) ---> Tx(USB to TTL)
* Tx(ESP8266) ---> Rx(USB to TTL)
* Power Supply (5V/3.3V and GND)
## Getting Started
Follow the steps for getting started:
* Connect the USB to TTL(CP2102) to USB port of PC and open device manager to check the port connected to serial bridge (USB to TTL).<br>
![Alt text](Images/deviceManager.png?raw=true "Title")
* Open Realterm or any other serial terminal you want to use.
* Open the port to which your serial device is connected make sure to check serial configuration as follows:
  1. Baudrate : 115200
  2. Data Bits : 8
  3. Parity : None
  4. Stopbits : 1 <br>

* That's it!!! Now you can send AT commands using realterm directly to Wi-Fi Module and also receive its response.
* Firstly check whether you receive ```OK``` in response to ```AT\r\n```, to make sure that your connections and configurations are fine.
* Now you can further proceed to other AT commands according to your application.
## Basic AT Commands
1. Basic AT Command: ```AT\r\n```
2. List Available networks: ```AT+CWLAP\r\n```
3. Connect to a network: ```AT+CWJAP=\"ssid\",\"password\"\r\n``` (ssid: netwok name, passwod: network password)
4. Ping Google to check internet availability: ```AT+PING=\"www.google.com\"\r\n```
